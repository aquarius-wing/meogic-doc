## First Stage: Whiteboard Organization

- The whiteboard can input blocks without pressure

- Optimize the lines on the whiteboard

- Words can be added to the lines

- Blocks on the whiteboard can have bidirectional and reverse links

- Surrounding these workflows, optimize according to user feedback, then end the third round of internal testing.

## Second Stage: Shorthand

- Diary outline, including bidirectional and reverse links

- Outlines can be inputted into the whiteboard without pressure

- Not only does diary have outlines' reverse link

- Combine diary with a whiteboard

-Surrounding these workflows, optimize according to user feedback, then end the fourth round of internal testing.

## Third Stage: Writing

- Hierarchical organization of documents

- The synchronous box integrates your written outline organically into writing while ensuring different descriptions under different environments for same semantics.

- Surrounding these workflows, optimize according to user feedback, then end fifth round of internal testing.
