# Zotero Connect App

When you first open it, Zotero Connect assumes your Zotero folder is in the default user folder.

- For MacOS, it's similar to `/Users/wing/Zotero`

- For Windows, it's similar to `C:\Users\wing\Zotero`

If the folder is incorrect, you can click on the edit button on the right to switch.

If there are problems loading data, you can click on the 'Reload' button at the far right to reload.

### Dragging Literature Annotations

Once you've opened up details about a piece of literature and have some annotations below it, these too can be dragged onto your whiteboard.
