# One Directional Layout Container

## Why do we need a layout container?

Because we believe that mind maps are a strict layout constraint, and whiteboards are too free. The balance between them is to set up a layout container.

Currently, only the vertical layout container has been released for unidirectional layout containers.

At present, the layout container does not support nesting. In our vision, the layout container can be multi-level nested.

You can freely combine a large horizontal layout container with multiple vertical ones nested inside it, just like a physical dashboard.

In the future when we have implemented attribute functionality, all cards under the same container could carry corresponding attributes which would make it truly function like a dashboard.
