# Combination Container

This is a container specifically designed for the dual-link function on the whiteboard in the future. It does not come with any layout effects, and whatever relative position you place in it will still maintain its corresponding position when moving the container.

## If there is no combination container

Then, on the whiteboard, the dual link can only see cards directly related to the corresponding block when backlinking.

## If there is a combination container

Then you can penetrate multiple levels of links and display the entire link map within it.
