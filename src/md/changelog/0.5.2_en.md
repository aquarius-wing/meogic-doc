## Additions
1. Added a 'Check for Updates' button in Settings -> About.

## Optimizations
1. The block text card changes to manual width after modifying its width, and it reverts back to automatic width with a double-click on the edge.
2. Block backlinks now support displaying the block text card they belong to.
3. Improved the scenario where removing a block from a block text card was fixed width, changing it to automatic width.
4. Optimized issue where clicking on a card on the whiteboard to bring it to the top accidentally caused other whiteboards to update as well.
5. Optimized accidental updates of other whiteboards when selecting an area on the whiteboard.
6. You can now click directly on bi-directional links to open them in the main view.
7. Optimized the addition of text at the end of block text so that the whiteboard automatically scrolls to keep the input part within view.
8. Updated the text prompts for joining the beta.
9. The AI functionality has been upgraded from gpt-4-0613 to gpt-4-1106-preview.

## Fixes
1. Fixed the issue where the block operation buttons remained visible after moving out of the edit area.
2. Fixed a bug where block text cards containing bi-directional links triggered the delete link command erroneously when a block was moved out and then back in.
